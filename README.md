# 🚀 Node.js Learning – Day 01  
## Topic: What is Node.js & Why It Exists

Today I’m starting my **Node.js learning journey**.  
This series will cover Node.js from **basics to production-level concepts**.

---

## 🔹 What is Node.js?

Node.js is a **runtime environment** that allows us to run **JavaScript outside the browser**.

It is built on:
- **Google Chrome’s V8 JavaScript Engine**
- Written in **C++ and JavaScript**

With Node.js, JavaScript can be used to build:
- Backend servers
- REST APIs
- Real-time applications
- Command-line tools

---

## 🔹 Why Node.js Was Created?

Before Node.js:
- JavaScript was limited to browsers
- Backend development relied on languages like Java, PHP, or Python

**Node.js solved this by enabling JavaScript on the server side.**

Problems it addressed:
- Blocking I/O operations
- Poor scalability for real-time apps
- Slow data handling

---

## 🔹 Key Features of Node.js

- **Single-threaded**
- **Non-blocking I/O**
- **Event-driven architecture**
- **High performance**
- **Powered by V8 Engine**

These features make Node.js highly scalable and efficient.

## 🔹 Where is Node.js Used?

Popular companies using Node.js:
- Netflix
- PayPal
- Uber
- LinkedIn
- Walmart

Node.js is commonly used for:
- Chat applications
- Streaming services
- API development
- Microservices architecture
