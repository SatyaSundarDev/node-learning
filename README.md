🚀 Node.js Learning – Day 01

Topic: What is Node.js & Why It Exists

Today I’m starting my Node.js learning journey.
Let’s begin with the basics.

🔹 What is Node.js?

Node.js is a runtime environment that allows us to run JavaScript outside the browser.

It is built on:

Google Chrome’s V8 JavaScript Engine

Written in C++ and JavaScript

This means JavaScript can be used to build:

Backend servers

APIs

Real-time applications

Command-line tools

🔹 Why Node.js Was Created?

Before Node.js:

JavaScript was limited to browsers

Backend used languages like Java, PHP, Python

Node.js solved this problem by enabling JavaScript on the server.

Key problems it addressed:

Poor scalability

Blocking I/O operations

Slow real-time communication

🔹 Key Features of Node.js

Single-threaded

Non-blocking I/O

Event-driven architecture

Highly scalable

Fast execution using V8

This makes Node.js perfect for:

Chat applications

Streaming services

APIs

Microservices

🔹 Where Node.js Is Used?

Companies using Node.js:

Netflix

PayPal

Uber

LinkedIn

Walmart

🔹 Important Takeaway (Day 01)

Node.js is not a framework.
It is a runtime environment that lets JavaScript run on the server efficiently.
